    Hi, thanks for visiting my page. my name is David. 
    I'm a maker and a tinkerer at heart. I believe that the closest thing to having a superpower in modern day is knowing how to program, a micro-controller and a 3D printer. What you can create is only limited by your imagination.
    
    I also graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Quantitative finance and risk analytics.

    - C / C++
    - Python

    - Linux
    - Docker
    - Flutter
